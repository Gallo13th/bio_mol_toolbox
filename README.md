# bio_mol_toolbox

I focus on such a toolbox for molecular biology, which is a collection of deeplearn models and tools for molecular biology.

Such topics are or will be included in this toolbox:

- biology molecular structure prediction
    - Protein structure prediction
    - RNA/DNA structure prediction
    - Complex structure prediction (Protein-RNA, Protein-DNA, Protein-Protein,etc.)

- biology molecular sequence prediction(design)
    - De novo design
    - Motif design
    - Based on structure
    - Based on SMILES

I hope this toolbox can predict or design sequences or structures of biology molecules at atomic level, not only at residue level.
