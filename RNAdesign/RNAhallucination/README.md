# RNA hallucination

This work was based on RhoFold(https://github.com/RFOLD/RhoFold)

So I just put the scripts for hallucination here.

I will update the model architecture and training scripts later.

## Methods

Now this tools support such design methods:

- Hallucination with no mutation sites

- De novo Hallucination

- Hallucination with structure constraints

## Usage

Now you should fetch the RhoFold code and put the hallucination.py in the same directory.

Then you can use the hallucination.py to design your RNA sequence.
